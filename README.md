## Features

- Supports Claude 3.7 (with optional extended thinking), ChatGPT-4o and o3-mini
- Terminal-based user interface with rich text formatting and code highlighting
- Support for multiline text input
- Streaming responses from the language model
- Conversations are saved as text files for portability and easy manipulation
- Anonymous chats that don't get saved anywhere
- You can edit the conversation at any point to add/remove context or edit the system prompt
- Change active model/conversation on the fly
- Embed files from the filesystem or webpage content by url in your prompts
- Quick temporary prompts that don't pollute the current conversation context
- Configurable via a YAML config file

## Installation

You can install `llm_chat_term` using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) by running:

```bash
uv tool install llm_chat_term
```

or if you don't have uv installed:

```bash
pip install llm_chat_term
# or
pipx install llm_chat_term
```

### Set up your API key(s)

On first run, a `config.yaml` with default options is created in your Config dir (e.g. ~/.config/llm_chat_term)
Edit it to add your API key(s) and customize other options. Then re-run the application.

Alternatively the application can read your API keys from your env (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)

## Usage

Run the chatbot from the command line:

```
llm_chat_term
```

### Controls

- Type your message and press `Alt(Esc)+Enter` to send
- Use `Enter` to add a new line in your message
- Type `:exit` or press `Ctrl+D` to exit the application
- Type `:help` to view help for available commands
- Press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt and exit
